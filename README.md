## KEY FINDINGS
## Overall Attrition Rate: 16%
### Overtime and Attrition: 
+  Overtime was found to have a strong link with attrition. Among all employees, 74.52% worked overtime while 25.48% did not. Of those who worked overtime, 30.5% eventually left the organization, compared to only 10.4% attrition among employees who did not work overtime.
### Travel Frequency and Attrition:
+  Attrition rates varied significantly based on travel frequency. Employees who travelled frequently recorded the highest attrition rate, at 24.9% out of 277 employees. In contrast, those with no travel had a much lower attrition rate of 8.0% out of 150 employees, while employees with some travel experienced an attrition rate of 15.9% out of 1,043 employees.
